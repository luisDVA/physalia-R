>This **rather unlikely linguistic cocktail** would probably never have been prepared by computer scientists, yet the language has become surprisingly popular...

> Most sessions are interactive, the user loads data and starts by plotting the data and making various simple summaries."

### Lazy Evaluation

.smallcode[
```{r, eval=FALSE}
addten <- function(x,y,z){
  x+10
}
addten(3) 
addten(3,10,10)
addten(3,"nothing","missing_variable")
```
]

**Evaluation:** process of analyzing an expression and giving the user a value (e.g. typing `2+1` in the console and pressing Enter)


**Why lazy?** Allows a program to be more efficient in interactive sessions: only the needed objects will be loaded in memory and/or looked for

.tr[
📖 Colin Fay  
[About lazy evaluation](https://colinfay.me/lazyeval/)]

---

## Object-oriented programming (OOP)


.pull-left[
- models real-world entities as software objects with associated data

- organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic

## Functional programming

In R, functional programming is much more important than object-oriented programming. We typically solve complex problems by decomposing them into simple **functions**, not simple objects.

## Why ~~some people dislike~~ `r fa(name = "r-project")` can be hard to learn

.pull-left[
- full of ambiguity and special cases...  
- slow
- packages change all the time
- The syntax is inconsistent

]

.pull-right[

- .orange.b[too many 'dialects']
- Third party package bloat 
- Unhelpful help files

### Many ways of doing the same thing 

```{r}
snacks <- data.frame(flavor=c("chocolate","strawberry","vanilla"),
                     calories=c(12,13,19),
                     in_stock=c(TRUE,TRUE,FALSE))

snacks
```

### Get the values of the column _flavor_ as a character vector

---

```{r, eval=FALSE}
snacks[,1]

snacks$flavor
snacks[,'flavor']
snacks[,c('flavor')]
snacks[['flavor']]
```

```{r}
snacks[,1]; snacks$flavor; snacks[,'flavor']
```

---

class: inverse, middle

# Can we come up with **5** more ways to extract these values?

---

## Assignment operators

_Assign a value to a name in an environment_

.tc[.b.f2[`=`] or .b.f2[`<-`] or .b.f2[`->`] or .b.f2[`assign()`]
]


.tr[
Colin Fay (2018)  
[Why do we use arrow as an assignment operator?](https://colinfay.me/r-assignment/)  
]

---

### Assignment

.pull-left[
```{r}
x <- 3
y = 3
3 -> z

x; y; z 
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
assign('w',3)
assign("q",3)
`<-`(k,3)

w; q; k
```
]

---

### Right-arrow assignment

>After typing a long expression only to remember at the end that it would be a good idea to save the result, .b[`->`] allows you to perform an assignment without retyping the line.

.tr[
_The New S Language_ (Becker, Chambers and Wilks 1988)]

### Useful at the end of chained operations
```{r, eval=FALSE}
msleep %>% 
  select(name,sleep_total) %>% 
  na.omit() -> msleep_subset

```

\*_We'll examine pipes later in this session_

---

```{r}
assign('w',3) == assign("w",3) 
```

# Quotes

Single (`'`) and double (`"`) quotes can be used interchangeably\* but double quotes are preferred. .underline[Single quotes are normally only used to delimit character constants containing double quotes]

.tr[
[Quotes Help Page](
https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/Quotes.html)
]

\* _Interchangeable as long as the same opening and closing quotes are used to delimit a character constant_

---

```{r, eval=FALSE}
c('dog","cat","mouse") # won't work
```


```{r}
c("dog","cat","mouse")
```

Character constants are always printed using double quotes
```{r}
c("dog",'cat',"mouse")
```


---

```{r}
print("she said yes")
```

```{r, error= TRUE}
print("she said "yes"") # will throw error
```

```{r}
print('she said "yes"') # works
```

## Pipes

To perform multiple operations in sequence:

--

- Nested code  (results evaluated from the inside out)

--

- Intermediate objects  (assign objects with intermediate results and pass on to the next function in a sequence)

--

- Pipes  (structure sequential operations left-to-right)

---

## Nested code

```{r, eval=TRUE}
scores <- c(7,8,8,10,6,9,5,9,8)

round(mean(scores), digits = 2)
```

---

## Intermediate objects

```{r, eval=TRUE}
mn_scrs <- mean(scores)

rd_mn_scrs <- round(mn_scrs, digits = 2)

rd_mn_scrs

```

---

Right Hand Side

<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
]]

<br/>

--

Take an **object** on the .avenir[Left Hand Side] of the pipe and insert it into a **function** as an argument on the .avenir[Right Hand Side] 


--

\* By default, .avenir[LHS] is placed as the **first** argument in the call 

---

## Pipes 

- Minimize the need for intermediate objects and nested code  

- Make code readable  

- Easy to add or remove steps 

> Insert with `ctrl + shift + M`

---

`LHS |> (or %>%) RHS(argument = 12)`

*parses to*

`RHS(LHS, argument = 12)`

> `magrittr` pipes are more permissive

When piping into a function with no arguments, parentheses are optional with **`%>%`** but required with **`|>`**

_less typing (by design) and less differentiation between functions and expressions on the RHS_

---

```{r, eval=TRUE}
scores |> 
  mean() |> 
  round(digits=2)

```{r, eval=TRUE, error=TRUE}

### `attach()`?

> Attach Set of R Objects to Search Path

### [The Search Path](https://rlang.r-lib.org/reference/search_envs.html#the-search-path)

> A chain of environments that determines what objects are visible from the global workspace

### environments
List-like objects that resemble a folder on our computer, binds a set of names to a set of values

- .f3[Make any assignment, and note how you have added an entry in the global environment (.b.red[`ls()`] will show what variables and functions are defined in the current environment)]

## Namespaces and the ' **`::`** ' operator

Namespace - management system that provides a context for looking up the value of an object associated with a name

- allow package developers to define which functions and data will be available for users that load the package

- prevent things from breaking when function names clash 

- provide a way to refer to an object within a particular package 

Disambiguate package elements with '`::`' (e.g. .blue.b[`dplyr::select()`])

Store files in a particular location, with intentional and meaningful names

- Use short, informative names

- Avoid using names for versioning (e.g. `var_V2_final_2020`)

- Choose names that sort well and work with searches for partial matches

## 📦 {`fs`}

Work with the file system (cross-platform)

`fs` functions always return ‘tidy’ paths 

Tidy paths: 
  - Always use '**`/`**' to delimit directories  
  - Never have multiple or trailing '**`/`**'

# Practice
_Try to only use the keyboard!_

- Create a new folder in your project's working directory ("my_new_dir")
- Check if it was created successfully
- Create two new folders in your new folder ("data" and "data2")
- Create a text file ('mydata.csv') and save it to file inside "data"
- List all the contents (hint use `recurse = TRUE`) 
- Move the text file to "data2"
- Import the data from the text file

## 📦 .black[{here}] and relative paths

.f5[`F:\path\that\no one\else\has\my-project\analysis\script1.R`]

Work relative to your project root using `here()`

- figures out the top-level of your current project
  
- helps build portable file paths  

- returns absolute paths (starting with `/`, `<drive letter>:\` or `\\`)

.f3[
.b[`here()`] does not set the working directory, it simply builds a path to the **top level** of your project file every time you use it  

.b[`here()`] is meant to figure out the top-level of a project (i.e. Where is the `.Rproj` file?) and build paths relative to this location

If we change the working directory with `setwd()` but nothing else changes in the project, the top-level directory remains unchanged

use .b[`dr_here()`] to get an explanation of how the top-level directory was determined
