## Overview

Many scientists start using R for very specific purposes with little training in computer science, data organization, and software development. Even advanced users may bypass important tools and abstractions which can ultimately lead to bad habits and wasting time. Get the most of R by exploring topics that usually fall outside of data analysis and visualization curricula. 

This course will cover blind spots in existing materials by working through the intermediate steps in various pairs of problems and solutions that often get overlooked because of assumed knowledge.

## Target audience

R users in scientific fields with a moderate amount of R and RStudio experience, for the most part self-taught, overwhelmed by the amount of resources, and interested in becoming more efficient.

## Program and materials

All slides are available as downloadable html slide decks (go to each link, right-click on the _Download_ button and save link). Rmd files for creating the slides with `xaringan` are also available in this repository. These course materials are released under a CC-BY-4.0 License.
